## Summary
This data package is associated with the publication "Organic Molecules are Deterministically Assembled in River Sediments" submitted to Scientific Reports (Stegen et al., 2024).

The study applies community ecology methods to dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemistry from variably inundated riverbed sediments to uncover principles governing DOM composition at a reach-scale. This data package documents the workflow used to process and generate the main findings in the manuscript. The R scripts reference the raw, unprocessed Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) data from another data package, available on ESS-DIVE at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1834208. The scripts then process the raw FTICR-MS data and generate the findings and figures presented in the associated manuscript. In brief, this study demonstrates that DOM assemblages in variably inundated sediments are primarily governed by deterministic variable selection, including sediment moisture effecting the degree of deterministic assembly. See the manuscript for more details pertaining to interpretation and implications of the findings.
